my solutions to bioinformatics-related coding problems on the website rosalind.info  

* Files are named according to their ID on rosalind.info. So for example, `dna.py` is my solution to the problem found at rosalind.info/problems/dna/
* Files are also organized into directories based on the locations of their corresponding problems on the website (Bioinformatics Stronghold, Bioinformatics Textbook Track, etc.)
