Rosalind

my solutions to bioinformatics-related coding problems on the website [rosalind.info](http://rosalind.info)

Requirements
============

- Python 2.4 or higher
- Biopython

Organization
============

- Files are named according to their ID on [rosalind.info](http://rosalind.info). So for example, `dna.py` is my solution to the problem found at [rosalind.info/problems/dna/](http://rosalind.info/problems/dna/)
- Files are also organized into directories based on the locations of their corresponding problems on the website (Bioinformatics Stronghold, Bioinformatics Textbook Track, etc.)
